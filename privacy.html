                when
                they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics. The
                information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
                Service
                Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are
                not
                linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for
                analyzing
                trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic
                information.
